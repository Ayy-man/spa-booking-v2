# Dermal Skin Clinic Booking System - Implementation Plan

**PROJECT STATUS: ðŸš€ NEW APPROACH - HTML/CSS/JavaScript**  
**Start Date: July 29, 2025**  
**System Approach: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (No Framework)**  

## New Implementation Strategy

We are abandoning the Next.js approach in favor of a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript website. This approach offers significant advantages for a medical spa booking system:

### **Advantages of HTML/CSS/JavaScript Approach**
- **Simpler**: No build process or framework complexity
- **Faster**: Direct HTML/CSS/JS loads instantly  
- **Easier to deploy**: Static hosting anywhere (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- **Better for booking sites**: Direct database integration without API layers
- **Easier to maintain**: Standard web technologies that any developer can work with
- **More reliable**: Fewer dependencies and potential failure points
