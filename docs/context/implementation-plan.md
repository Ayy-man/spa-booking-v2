**Objective**: Implement 15-minute buffers between all appointment slots to improve service quality and reduce scheduling conflicts.

### 15-Minute Buffer Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

#### Technical Implementation
**Location**: `/src/app/booking/date-time/page.tsx`
**Function**: `generateFallbackTimes()`

#### Features Implemented
- ✅ **Automatic Buffer Calculation**: Each time slot includes service duration + 15-minute buffer

#### Technical Details
```typescript
// Buffer calculation logic
const serviceDuration = selectedService?.duration || 60
const bufferMinutes = 15

// Move to next slot: add service duration + 15-minute buffer
currentTime.setMinutes(currentTime.getMinutes() + serviceDuration + bufferMinutes)
```

#### Examples of Time Slots with 15-Minute Buffer
- **30-minute services**: 9:00-9:30, 9:45-10:15, 10:30-11:00, 10:45-11:15
