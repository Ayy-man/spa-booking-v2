# Dermal Skin Clinic Booking System - Implementation Plan

**PROJECT STATUS: üîÑ PIVOTED BACK TO NEXT.JS**  
**Start Date: July 29, 2025**  
**Current Date: July 29, 2025**  
**System Approach: Next.js with Supabase (Original Architecture)**  

## Implementation Update - July 29, 2025

After further investigation, we discovered the Next.js implementation is more functional than initially assessed. We have pivoted back to using the existing Next.js architecture rather than rebuilding in vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

### **Today's Progress Summary**
- ‚úÖ Fixed all TypeScript errors (booking_date -> appointment_date)
- ‚úÖ Connected to Supabase database successfully
- ‚úÖ Removed all demo/prototype warnings
- ‚úÖ Fixed staff availability display issues
- ‚úÖ Resolved white screen build errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Created SQL functions but NOT installed yet
- ‚ùå Blocked by RLS policies preventing booking creation

### RLS Policy Fixes Needed
```sql
-- Allow anonymous users to create customers
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous customer creation" ON customers
FOR INSERT TO anon WITH CHECK (true);

## Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All 50+ services display and are selectable
- ‚úÖ Database connection established
- ‚ùå RLS policies allow booking creation
- ‚ùå Staff filtering by service capabilities
- ‚ùå Date-based staff availability
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive design working
- ‚úÖ Fast loading times achieved
- ‚ùå Complete error handling implementation
- ‚ùå Data persists correctly (blocked by RLS)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UI issues partially resolved

## Current Blockers
1. **RLS Policies**: Preventing all database writes
2. **SQL Functions**: Not installed in database
3. **Staff Filtering**: Not connected to real data
4. **Availability Checking**: Using hardcoded data

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Cannot create bookings until RLS fixed
- **Medium Risk**: Staff selection allows invalid choices
- **Low Risk**: UI polish issues affect user experience
- **Mitigated**: TypeScript errors resolved, builds working
