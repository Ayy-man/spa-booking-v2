# Medical Spa Booking System - Current Status

## âœ… System is Now Functional!

The database functions and RLS policies have been successfully installed. The booking system should now be working correctly.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Database Functions Installed**
   - `process_booking` - Creates bookings with conflict checking
   - `get_available_time_slots` - Shows real availability
   - `assign_optimal_room` - Assigns rooms based on business rules
   - `check_staff_capability` - Filters staff by service
   - `get_staff_schedule` - Gets staff working hours

2. **RLS Policies Fixed**
   - Anonymous users can now create customers
   - Anonymous users can now create bookings
   - Public read access to services, staff, and rooms

3. **Frontend Updates**
   - Room assignment now uses the database function
   - Better error handling for RLS issues
   - Real-time availability checking is active

## Quick Testing Steps

1. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the booking flow**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/booking
   - Select a service
   - Pick a date and time
   - Choose available staff
   - Enter customer info
   - Confirm booking

3. **Verify in database**
   Run this query in Supabase:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM bookings 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
