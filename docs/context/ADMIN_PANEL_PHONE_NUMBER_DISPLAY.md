# Admin Panel Phone Number Display Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of customer phone number display across the admin panel, ensuring that staff can easily access customer contact information for all bookings and walk-ins.

## Problem Identified
The admin panel was not displaying customer phone numbers in the main bookings table, even though:
- Phone numbers were being stored in the database (`customers.phone` field)
- Phone numbers were being fetched from the database
- Phone numbers were only visible in the detailed booking modal

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Main Admin Bookings Table (`/admin/bookings`)
**File**: `src/app/admin/bookings/page.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Added a new "Phone" column header between "Customer" and "Service"
- Added phone number display in the new column
- Imported and used `formatPhoneNumber` function for consistent formatting
- Phone numbers now display as `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` format

**Before**: Phone numbers were hidden, only customer name and email visible
**After**: Phone numbers are prominently displayed in a dedicated column

### 2. Simple Admin Page (`/admin/simple`)
**File**: `src/app/admin/simple/page.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Phone numbers were already being displayed but in raw format
- Updated to use `formatPhoneNumber` function for consistent formatting
- Applied to both active and cancelled bookings sections

**Before**: Phone numbers displayed as raw digits (e.g., "5551234567")
**After**: Phone numbers formatted as `(555) 123-4567`

### 3. Booking Details Modal
**File**: `src/components/admin/BookingDetailsModal.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Phone numbers were already being displayed but in raw format
- Updated to use `formatPhoneNumber` function for consistent formatting
- Phone numbers now display in the customer information section with proper formatting

**Before**: Phone numbers displayed as raw digits
**After**: Phone numbers formatted as `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`

### 4. Walk-ins Section
**File**: `src/components/admin/walk-ins-section.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Phone numbers were being displayed in raw format
- Updated to use `formatPhoneNumber` function for consistent formatting
- Phone numbers now display with proper formatting in walk-in cards

**Before**: Phone numbers displayed as raw digits
**After**: Phone numbers formatted as `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`

### 5. Staff Schedule View
**File**: `src/components/admin/StaffScheduleView.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Phone numbers were being displayed in customer dropdowns in raw format
- Updated to use `formatPhoneNumber` function for consistent formatting
- Phone numbers now display properly in customer selection dropdowns

**Before**: Phone numbers displayed as raw digits in dropdowns
**After**: Phone numbers formatted as `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` in dropdowns

## Technical Implementation

### Phone Number Formatting
**Function**: `formatPhoneNumber` from `@/lib/phone-utils`
**Format**: `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` for 10-digit numbers
**Usage**: Applied consistently across all admin components

### Database Integration
**No Changes Required**: Phone numbers were already being fetched from the database
**Field**: `customers.phone` (already exists and populated)
**Query**: Already included in all relevant database queries

### Component Updates
All admin components now:
1. Import `formatPhoneNumber` function
2. Apply consistent phone formatting
3. Display phone numbers prominently where relevant
