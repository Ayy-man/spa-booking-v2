## Failed Tests Analysis

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

#### 1. Buffer Time Enforcement (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue:** 15-minute buffer between appointments not being enforced  
**Impact:** Potential scheduling conflicts, insufficient room cleaning time  
**Test:** `should respect 15-minute buffer time`  
**Fix Required:** Update `checkBookingConflicts` function to properly calculate buffer time

#### 2. 30-Day Advance Booking Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Error message shows "past dates" instead of "30-day limit"  
**Impact:** Confusing user experience, incorrect validation feedback  
**Test:** `should validate appointment times comprehensively`  
**Fix Required:** Update `validateBookingTime` function date range logic

#### 3. Complete Booking Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Valid booking combinations returning false validation  
**Impact:** Users unable to complete legitimate bookings  
**Test:** `should validate complete booking request successfully`  
**Fix Required:** Review validation chain in `validateBookingRequest`

### UI Component Implementation Gaps

#### 4. Missing UI Components (LOW PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Alert component not found, some UI utilities missing  
**Impact:** Component tests failing, potential runtime errors  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Alert component created during testing
**Recommendation:** Complete UI component library implementation

#### 5. DateTimePicker Component Mismatch (LOW PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Test expectations don't match actual component implementation  
**Impact:** Test failures, potential regression detection issues  
**Fix Required:** Align test expectations with actual component API
